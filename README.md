# Kinect Virtual Dressing Room

This repo contains my contribution towards huge University project, realized for Integrated Decision Systems class. I was co-author of the script in charge of face detection and face tracking. In our work we used MTCNN face detector, and also we used numpy, opencv and dlib features. Later as the work progress i was in charge of the optimization process of our face system. (Sequential detecting and tracking on subsequent frames)
